# ‚ö° Cyclotron Simulation  

A Python simulation of a **cyclotron particle accelerator**, where a charged particle spirals outward under the influence of alternating electric fields and a perpendicular magnetic field.

## ‚ú® Features
- Implements the **Lorentz force law**  
- Alternating RF electric field in the ‚ÄúD-gap‚Äù  
- Uniform perpendicular magnetic field in the cyclotron region  
- Tracks **particle trajectory** (spiral path)  
- Computes **kinetic energy vs time** (staircase growth)  
- Visualizes results with Matplotlib
