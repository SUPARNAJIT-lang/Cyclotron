# ‚ö° Cyclotron Simulation  

A Python simulation of a **cyclotron particle accelerator**, where a charged particle spirals outward under the influence of alternating electric fields and a perpendicular magnetic field.

## ‚ú® Features
- Implements the **Lorentz force law**  
- Alternating RF electric field in the ‚ÄúD-gap‚Äù  
- Uniform perpendicular magnetic field in the cyclotron region  
- Tracks **particle trajectory** (spiral path)  
- Computes **kinetic energy vs time** (staircase growth)  
- Visualizes results with Matplotlib

## üì∏ Sample Output  

**Trajectory (x vs y):**  
Spiral growth due to acceleration inside the cyclotron.

## üßë‚Äçüî¨ Physics Background
- The particle is confined by a **magnetic field** `B` perpendicular to its velocity.  
- Acceleration occurs in the **gap region** with an oscillating **electric field** `E`.  
- Each time the particle crosses the gap, it gains a ‚Äúkick‚Äù of energy.  
- The motion is governed by the **Lorentz force equation**:
